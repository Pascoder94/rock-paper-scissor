# rock-paper-scissor
Attempt #2 at making a Rock, Paper, Scissor game because something has gone horribly wrong with Git and I have messed up big time. Note to self: it's fundamental to get more practice with Git.

GOAL: Write a simplistic javascript "game" that allows the user to play Rock,Paper,Scissor against the Computer and use this project to refresh my (lacking) Git knowledge and simulate a real life working enviroment in coding.

PSEUDOCODE (I will update this as I go through the steps of the assignment):

1) Create a way for user to type  a string between "rock", "paper", "scissor."
2) Simulate computer choice by randomly generating a number between 1 and 3.
3) Associate "rock","paper" and "scissor" to 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
4) In the console output the resulting string (eg: "The computer chose: Rock!")
